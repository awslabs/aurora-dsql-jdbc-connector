# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Aurora DSQL JDBC Connector!

## How to contribute

### Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already
reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of our code being used
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment

### Contributing via Pull Requests

Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the *main* branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.

To send us a pull request, please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change.
3. Ensure local tests pass.
4. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
5. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
6. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.

GitHub provides additional document on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and
[creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

* Java 24 or higher
* Gradle 8.14 or higher (included via Gradle connector)
* Git

### Building the Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/aurora-dsql-jdbc-connector.git
cd aurora-dsql-jdbc-connector

# Build the project
./gradlew build

# Run tests
./gradlew test

# Generate code coverage report
./gradlew jacocoTestReport

# Run static analysis
./gradlew spotbugsMain spotbugsTest
```

### Running Tests

The project includes both unit tests and integration tests:

#### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run all unit tests
./gradlew test

# Run tests for a specific class
./gradlew test --tests "AuroraDsqlConnectionConnectorTest"

# Run tests with coverage
./gradlew test jacocoTestReport
```

#### Integration Tests
Integration tests require a real Aurora DSQL cluster and AWS credentials:

```bash
# Set required environment variables
export AURORA_DSQL_ENDPOINT=your-cluster-endpoint.dsql.us-east-1.on.aws
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1

# Run integration tests
./gradlew test --tests "*IntegrationTest"
```

### Code Style and Quality

This project follows specific coding standards:

#### Code Style
* Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
* Maximum line length of 120 characters
* No wildcard imports - use explicit imports only
* Follow Google Java Style Guide conventions

#### Quality Checks
```bash
# Run all quality checks
./gradlew check

# Run SpotBugs analysis
./gradlew spotbugsMain spotbugsTest

# Generate code coverage report
./gradlew jacocoTestReport
```

#### Import Guidelines
**✅ Correct:**
```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.sql.SQLException;
```

**❌ Incorrect:**
```java
import java.sql.*;
```

### Testing Guidelines

#### Unit Test Structure
```java
@Test
void testMethodName_WhenCondition_ThenExpectedResult() {
    // Arrange
    String input = "test input";
    
    // Act
    String result = methodUnderTest(input);
    
    // Assert
    assertEquals("expected", result);
}
```

#### Integration Test Requirements
* Use `@EnabledIfSystemProperty` for conditional execution
* Clean up resources in `@AfterEach` methods
* Use realistic test data
* Test with actual Aurora DSQL connections

#### Mock Usage
* Use Mockito for mocking dependencies
* Mock external dependencies, not the class under test
* Verify interactions when behavior matters
* Use `@SuppressFBWarnings` for test-specific SpotBugs warnings

### Documentation

#### Javadoc Requirements
All public APIs must include comprehensive Javadoc:

```java
/**
 * Creates a connection to Aurora DSQL with automatic token management.
 * 
 * <p>This method handles:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>IAM token generation and refresh</li>
 *   <li>Connection lifetime management (60-minute limit)</li>
 *   <li>Prepared statement re-preparation on connection refresh</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * @param url the Aurora DSQL cluster endpoint URL
 * @param properties connection properties including user and token settings
 * @return a connection connector with automatic management features
 * @throws SQLException if the connection cannot be established
 */
```

#### README Updates
Update the README.md file when:
* Adding new features or configuration options
* Changing existing behavior
* Adding new dependencies
* Modifying build or setup procedures

## Aurora DSQL Specific Considerations

When contributing to this connector, keep in mind Aurora DSQL's unique characteristics:

### Token Management
* IAM tokens have configurable lifetime
* Tokens are cached and refreshed automatically

## Commit Message Guidelines

Use clear, descriptive commit messages following conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
* `feat`: New feature
* `fix`: Bug fix
* `docs`: Documentation changes
* `test`: Test additions or modifications
* `refactor`: Code refactoring
* `perf`: Performance improvements
* `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat(connection): add automatic connection refresh
fix(token): resolve token expiration race condition
docs(readme): update configuration examples
test(integration): add long-lived connection tests
```
